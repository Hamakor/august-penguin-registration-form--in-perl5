This is an old registration form that
[Shlomi Fish](http://www.shlomifish.org/) wrote for use by the
[August Penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Penguin) conference
using Perl 5 and some CPAN modules. I do not recall if it was actually
utilised.

It is open source under the MIT/Expat licence, but you may be able to find
far superior FOSS alternatives around.
